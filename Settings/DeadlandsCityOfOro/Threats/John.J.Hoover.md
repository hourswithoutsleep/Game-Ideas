* Argue with the posse.
* Reveal something.
* Freak out in terror.

When the manitou is in charge, his motivation is to create chaos and he is likely to do the following kinds of things:

* Burst forth with sudden, uncontrolled violence.
* Capture someone or steal something.
* Use an unnatural power.

### Harrowed Powers
* __Dead Man’s Hand__ Harrowed with this power can continue to
control their own severed body parts—usually a hand or an eye—for short periods of time, even if they’re out of sight. To use the Edge, the deader rolls Spirit and either slices off his own hand with a Bowie knife or similar implement or plucks out an eyeball.
With a success, the body part remains active and under its owner’s mental control up to a Range of the dead man’s Smarts x5, or Smarts
x10 on a raise. On a failure, the deader suffers an automatic wound and an Injury (either Arm or Head, Blinded, as appropriate), which persists
until the deader reattaches the body part and passes a Spirit test at –2, or until he succeeds on his next Natural Healing roll and grows it back.
The deader can maintain the Dead Man’s Hand as long as he wishes, but while it’s active it commands a portion of his attention, inflicting a
–2 penalty on other Trait rolls. Additionally, the hero is assumed to have the One Arm or One Eye Hindrance until the body part is reattached.
Severed hands use the Animate Hand profile (see the Deadlands Marshal’s Handbook). Although they’re pretty tough, severed hands are much better at opening jail cells and causing distractions than beating the Hell out of someone. Or the deader could pluck out an eyeball and give it to a compadre so the Harrowed can spy on the scene when he’s not around.
* __Death Mask__ Use of this Edge allows a Harrowed to appear as they did while drawing breath. Folks suffer a –4 penalty to Notice to determine the deader isn’t, well, dead. Keeping this power active requires concentration, so the Harrowed suffers a –2 penalty to all other Trait rolls while maintaining a death mask.
Additionally, if the Harrowed is Shaken or suffers one or more wounds, he must make a Spirit roll (at –2) to keep the disguise active. Detect arcana automatically sees through this effect.
* __Ghost__ As his first action during his turn, the Harrowed can become incorporeal with a successful Spirit roll (he can perform no actions, including free actions, before using Ghost). Once incorporeal, he must remain in that state until the beginning of his action on the next round (unless he suffers damage, see below). While ghosted, the Harrowed is intangible unaffected by the physical world and unable to affect it though he is still visible and magical attacks affect him normally.
The deader may remain ghosted as long as he wishes, but it requires concentration and inflicts a –2 penalty to all other Trait rolls while it is maintained. With a free action, the Harrowed can become tangible again at the beginning of his turn. If he somehow suffers damage (Shaken,
or one or more wounds) say, from a magical or supernatural attack—while in this state, he must make a Spirit roll at –2 or immediately become
tangible.
* __Hell Fire__ There’s a reason why flames figure prominently in the Hells of pretty much every religion. Many supernatural beings have a love affair with the destructive power of fire.
A Harrowed with this power suffers one die less damage than usual from fire, though he will still catch fire if exposed to flames. What’s more, with a successful Spirit roll, he can cause a fire to flare or die at his whim.
On a raise, he can extinguish the fire, or he can cause it to explode, showering everything in a Medium Burst Template in flames. Roll to see if flammable material ignites, as usual (see Savage Worlds).
