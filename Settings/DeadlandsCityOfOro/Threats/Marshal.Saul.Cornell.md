**[Marshal Saul Cornell](../Faces/Marshal.Saul.Cornell.md)** is the town marshal, a distinguished older man who tries to talk those law-breakers down first, but in doing so generally provokes a killing rage in one of the others listening near by.

* Order underlings to do terrible acts.
* Escape, no matter how well contained he is.
* Boast and gloat, maybe revealing a secret.
* Use an unnatural power.

### Special Abilities

* __Demagoguery:__ If it is able to address a crowd, an agent provocateur may sap the wills of listeners and persuade them to commit a violent act. This works like the puppet power, except it costs no Power
Points and the agent can affect every Extra in a radius equal to his Smarts die x2 (24”) who can both see and hear him. The agent provocateur makes a Persuasion roll, opposed by a single group Spirit roll (plus
Wild Die) for the crowd. On a success, the listeners are compelled to commit a single act as suggested by the agent provocateur.
* __Master of Persuasion:__ An agent provocateur has Persuasion d12+2, and rolls a d10 Wild Die when using the skill.
* __Oily as Hell:__ An agent provocateur can initiate a Persuasion Test of Will, opposed by the target’s Smarts.
* __Puppet:__ An agent provocateur can control a single person’s will with a successful Persuasion roll. This works like the puppet power, but costs no Power Points to use and cannot be maintained beyond its base duration of 3 rounds.
* __Strong-Willed:__ Agent provocateurs get a +2 bonus on Tests of Will, and to Spirit and Smarts rolls when resisting them.

### Notes

1. Is working to make the town more violent by encouraging them to lynch anyone who spends the night in his jail.
