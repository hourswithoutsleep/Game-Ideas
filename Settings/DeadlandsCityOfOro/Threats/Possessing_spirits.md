### Special Abilities

* __Possession:__ With an opposed Spirit roll, all kachinas have the ability to possess a target within a range equal to its Smarts die in
inches. If the kachina succeeds, it remains in control of a victim’s body—and its Physical Attributes and linked skills—for 1d6 hours, and then vanishes. While it is in control, the target’s soul is cast into the Hunting Grounds. If the target instead scores a raise on the Spirit roll, he gains all the kachina’s special abilities for 1d6 hours and retains control of his body.

* __Masau’u:__ Masau’u are skeletal spirits of death, fire, darkness, and war. They guard the gates to the Deadlands, and are bad news. Masau’u have 25 Power Points, and know the burst, curse, obscure, and smite powers.
