# Deadlands City of Oro

This repo contains information on the Deadlands campaign that I am running set in the City of Oro. As more information is learned by the players, I will add that information to the master branch.

## Oro City
#### Fear Level: 3

##### Theme: Gold Boomtown gone bust, silver town on the rise.

Oro City is currently a small town about four days travel west south west of Denver. In the 1860's a large placer gold discovery was made and a town quickly grew up as more prospectors flocked to the region. In a handful of months there were about 10,000 residents in the area. Placer mining is the mining of a stream bead for minerals. You can find more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placer_mining). Unfortunately the richest deposits have been exhausted and most drifted away. In the 1870's it was determined that the heavy brown sand that made the placer mining difficult was a lead based mineral called cerussite(Cerussite is a lead based crystal. More can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerussite).) and that the sand also contained a lot of silver. This lead to a silver boom, but most people moved to a new town further down the river. Now the town is down to just over 300 souls as the last of the ore runs out and the fear grows.
