**William Nye** is the town's assessor and maintains a list of all the mining claims in the area. He also is the one that ultimately decides when a claim is abandoned and puts it up for auction. He is likely to do the following things:

* Go off alone.
* Argue with the posse.
* Try to help the posse.
