## The Church

**The Church** is te town's church. Until recently it was not in use as the last Preacher left town suddenly, but with the arrival of Reverend Edward Browne the locals are hoping the town becomes more genteel. The following things are likely to happen here:

* Hide something.
* Open a way.
* Offer a guide.
* Reveal something.
* Present a hazard.
